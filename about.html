            <h2>Hello, my name is Mirza.</h2>
            
            <p>I share a deep passion in just about <b>anything</b> related to computers and technology including (but not limited to) hardware/software, programming, video games, and some interest in CG art. I was born and raised here in Canada alongside my two younger sisters, but the rest of my family was born and raised in Pakistan.</p>
            
            <p>Programming has caught my interest since third grade, when I found a JavaScript fundamentals course on Khan Academy and decided to teach myself it, and I had a computer at a very young age which very much honed my technical skills. Even with all of this knowledge absorbed, I feel like I do not know enough or am not experienced enough for the field; that's why I want to take this program to learn a little bit of everything and decide a field from there.</p>
