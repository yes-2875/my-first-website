            <p>This is my first website created to test basic HTML capabilities in web design. And it's also a way to introduce myself.</p>
            
            <p>My favourite website? <a href="https://fmhy.net">The FMHY Wiki</a>. It's the <b><i>largest</i></b> collection of free stuff on the internet, verified half-monthly by its community for safety, security, and reliability, and I'm not ashamed to be using it. In fact, I recommend that everyone does so because subscription prices these days are outrageous. There are some really useful guides here for just about anything and the pirates provide a mostly better service anyways, so why not sail the high seas sometimes? üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è And no, I wasn't paid to say this, this is actually a generational site.</p>
